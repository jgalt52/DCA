Denver Crime App

This is a C# project that takes data from :https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/denver-crime-data#crime.csv and maps the crime of denver on a map.

-Things to do:
  Parse CSV and get all the points listed on the map
    Parse further so that each crime has a different color based on severity
    
  Display crime based on type and distance from point of interest
  
  Anything else I think to do maybe something mapping real-estate prices to crime in neighborhoods
